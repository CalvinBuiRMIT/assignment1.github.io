            <h1>Week 2</h1>

        <ol>
    <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
    <p>When loading on, I was welcomed by a black screen with a sentence acknowledging the traditional land owners of NGV - the  Wurundjeri Woi-Wurrung People. By clicking anywhere on the screen, the webpage revealed in which my attention immediately got drawn by the big rotating banner on top - showing featured events currently being held at NGV. I paid attention to it obviously because the banner was the biggest section of the screen, but also how the choice of fonts, colour contrasts made the section stand out from the rest.
    </p>
    <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li>
   
    <ul>
<li>Switching events on the top banner</li>
<li>Quickly scroll to scan from top to bottom</li>
<li>Hovering my mouse into textbox, images to see the interactions</li>
<li>Pressing on the small triangle icon to read the dropdown menu</li>
<li>Pressing on “See all exhibitions” which sent me to a different page with list of exhibitions</li>
    </ul>
   
    <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
    <p>I frequently look more into detail of the featured events, by clicking on an event from the top banner to see what it is about, and repeating the same process for other events like the “Alexander McQueen exhibition” or the “NGV Friday Nights”. I spent the most time engaging with it because it pulled my attention the most, due to its size and design.</p>
    <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
    <p>The most common action would be hovering my cursor into different visuals to see what they do, this is also the easiest way to experience any webpage. Another action would be clicking on “Find out more” or “See all”, as these will lead to more information/visuals that the webpage provides. This is an efficient structure to store, retrieve, and present information clearly.
    </p>
    <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
    <p>Since The National Gallery of Victoria is an art museum in Melbourne, the website aims to promote its  events, artworks and exhibitions with an efficient & convenient layout. In my opinion, NGV has done a great job in promoting its events & exhibitions, also bringing the audiences closer to its promoted artworks and encouraging them to read further details.</p>
    <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li>
    <p>Not only did the website provide many stunning visuals throughout, the scrolling animation (fade-reveal) also makes the audience want to scroll more to look at different exhibitions. The smart layout made the experience very easy to access every section, which is the Z-pattern where people can look at texts and still glance at visuals. The website also has an “Engage” section, where audiences can watch, read or listen about every piece of artwork, diving in about its history and how it was created.
    </p>
    <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
    <p>In my opinion, in order to interact with the website it would be pretty fast since the actions are quite simple (clicking, hovering, scrolling). However, to experience every artworks and information the webpage provides it would take quite a long time since there are a lot of artworks and exhibitions to cover. Besides having a quick look through the website, diving in each section full of artworks would take one hour or more. The website will update frequently due to new events coming up therefore the experience will be slightly different after a period of time.
    </p>
    <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
    <p>With each section opening up to more artworks and galleries, the audiences will spend quite some time looking generally at the images and visuals, to more detailed information about how each art piece was made, the history behind it, etc. As not every event is permanent, the website will update when new events/exhibitions/galleries are being held at NGV. New visuals, information, trending art collections will be updated on the website which bring newness and variety to the experience of the audiences.
    </p>
        </ol>

            <h1>Week 3</h1>

        <ol start="9">
    <li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li>
    <p>Besides just images which provide visual experience to users, the webpage also references ebooks/listens, which are read to the audience, providing audio experiences. There are also videos, a mixture of audio and visual, virtual tour in 3D,or art magazines/journals.
    </p>
    <li>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</li>
    <p>By engaging with different media forms, I will have to use other senses to experience better besides just visuals. From listening to the tracks provided within the webpage to reading art magazines, journals, or having a wider view in 3D from the “virtual tour option”, or a mix of all senses. These create a variety of different experiences which makes the website more interesting.
    </p>
    <li>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</li>
    <p>Looking at visuals makes me feel the beauty of colours, arrangements in each artwork while reading magazines and journals can help me learn more about them. However, listening to ebooks or tracks creates a different feel to interact with the information. It requires no action besides hearing but it lacks visuals. Therefore, I can have an audio-visual experience with videos, which requires no reading and I find it a more relaxing experience. 3D interaction through virtual tours is the most exciting one, however. I have a wider view through it, and makes me want to dive in and explore more virtually.</p>
    <li>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</li>
    <p>A frustrating experience from the NGV website would be the overload of information. From sections to each artwork to each history being told, audiences might lose track of what they read, and have to go back to the previous page to catch up. I find this quite inconvenient, where the navigation bar can only help us go to other big sections or back to the main page. If the navigation bar has a drop-down menu to smaller categories, sub-sections, it would make it easier and more efficient to navigate, explore and read.</p>
    <li>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</li>
    <p>Through the most simple actions like scrolling, hovering with a fading animation, the website already makes me feel satisfied, since it looks more seamless with more white spaces and smooth transitions. However, I find the 3D virtual tour section of the website most satisfying to me. It is satisfying since the visuals are laid out in 3D, where I can pan around, view in different angles with a very smooth zoom (in and out) transition.</p>
